                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p><em>Lasagna</em> is the name of one of the <strong>oldest and best-known pasta shapes</strong> rectangular or ribbon shaped,</p>
                <p> thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants.</p>
                <p> After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling</p>
                <p> that varies based on different local traditions. </p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sweet Italian Sausage</li>
                    <li>Homemade Sauce</li>
                    <li>Fresh Basil and Fresh Parsley</li>
                    <li>Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese</li>
                    <li>Nutmeg</li>
                    <li>Whole Milk Mozzarella</li>
                    <li>Provolone, Romano and Parmesan Cheeses</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Steps </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make the sauce. The day before I want to cook and serve the lasagna, I make the sauce.</li>
                    <li>While the sauce is cooking, mix together the cheeses and cook the noodles if youâ€™d like.</li>
                    <li>Put the lasagna together. Allow the lasagna to sit for 30 minutes or so until the sauce cools, then cover the pan with plastic wrap and slip it into the fridge to sit overnight. If you cover with aluminum foil, the acid in the sauce may eat away at it as it sits. For that reason, I prefer plastic wrap.</li>
                    <li>Remove the lasagna from the refrigerator 45 minutes before baking, then bake as the recipe states.</li>
                </ol>
